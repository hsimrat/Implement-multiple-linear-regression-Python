to implement multiple linear regression on the Ecommerce-Customers.csv data set 
to implement multiple linear regression on the Ecommerce-Customers.csv data set and answer the following questions.
(a)   Use pandas to load Ecommerce-Customers.csv. Set display.max_columns as 4. Display the top 5 rows of the dataframe. 
(b)  Display a heatmap to present the correlation values between different variables, comment on the observation. 
(c)   Use statsmodels.api package to perform a multiple linear regression with Yearly Amount Spent as the response and all other variables (whatever is suitable) as the predictors. Use the summary2() function to print the results. Comment on following points based on the output.
i. Is there a relationship between the predictors and the response?
ii. Which predictors appear to have a statistically significant relationship to the response?
iii. What does the coefficient for the Time on App variable suggest?
iv. Is there any independent variable which is statistically insignificant? Comment on how we can use this information to improve the model.
(d)   Comment on whether the residuals of the model follow a normal distribution with appropriate charts.
